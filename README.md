# TextAnalyzer:

This is my first program written in Java.

It takes your input as a string and calculates the percentage
of each character with respect to the whole string, as well as a barchart.

**Example:**

- Please enter a sentence: this is a test
  a: 9%  =========

  e: 9%  =========

  h: 9%  =========

  i: 18% ==================

  s: 27% ===========================

  t: 18% ==================

  T: 9% ==========

**==================================**

**What I learned from this project:**

How to use basic Java syntax:
    
    input and output

    declaring primitive & reference variables
    
    for-loops

    methods

    Understanding the scope of variables (method scope, loop scope etc)
